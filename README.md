Throughout our marketing website(s), there are instances in which we leverage custom JS and/or JS libraries for enhanced functionality. 
The preferred way to target elements on these pages is by element ID. 
For, we are constantly changing and updating the CSS. 

Here are some of the categories for our files:
1. Module — Modules are "popups" that can be triggered either by a button, or an interaction. More custom JS can be nested within a Module. 
2. Splide — Splide.js is a JS library we use specfically for "infinite carousels". 
3. Swiper — Swiper.js is a JS library we use for all slider elements due to Webflow's native slider having weak interactivity features.
4. Component — This is for any misc code component. 
5. GSAP — GSAP is a JS library we use for any complex Webflow animations. It's less code and a lot smoother than Webflow native interactions.
